# Comic-Unpacker
Extracts every rar, zip, cbr, and cbz file in a directory.

Note: I made this for my own personal use, and it works exactly how I intended it to. I most likely won't be updating it. So enjoy the bland interface. :D
(You could always, ya know, fork the project and adjust it to your liking.)

Download the exe here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/gsqtlza6fafcxpm/comicunpacker.zip?dl=0

Howto:
- Open the file comicunpacker.exe
- Type in the address of the folder containing all the cbr / rar / cbz / zip files. (ex C:\Program Files\Comics\ProgrammerMan)
    - Protip: CTRL + C to copy, and CTRL + V to paste (Windows).
- Hit the extract button.
- A new folder called "Extracted" will be created in the folder containing the comic files.
- Most of the files will be there, but some might not have worked. Check the second window to see which ones were not extracted.
